				<font face="arial,helvetica" size=-1><span>
<b>Siege on Harrogath</b><BR>
Harrogath is under siege by Baal's demons.  If you wish to make good on your promise and 
prove yourself to Larzuk and the others bring those infernal catapults to a halt.  
They are threatening to bring down the very walls around us.
<p>
<b>Given</b> by Larzuk or by entering the siege area near Shenk the Overseer.<p>
<b>Tip:</b> If you reach the wooded bridge to the Frigid Highlands you have gone too far. Search the Bloody Foothills
for a SuperUnique Monster (Shenk the Overseer) in a special area surrounded by many minions. Kill him.<p> 
<!--- Rescue on Mount Arreat -------------------------------->

				<font face="arial,helvetica" size=-1><span>
<b>Rescue on Mount Arreat</b><BR>
Since the siege has ended, Qual-Kehk has turned his concern toward his men
still imprisoned among the demons. The gods only know what's being done with them.
 In your journey up the mountain keep your eyes open for Qual-Kehk's soldiers and bring them back to him if you can.
<p>
<b>Given</b> by Qual-Kehk after defeating Shenk the Overseer, 
or by entering the Frigid Highlands.
<P>
<b>Tip:</b> Search the many fortress areas for special areas on the Automap. They will appear in white.
Knock the doors down to release the Barbarians. It is possible to fail this quest. If it says unable
to complete quest, you have failed. Create a new game and try again.<p> 
<!--- Prison of Ice -------------------------------->
			<tr>

				<font face="arial,helvetica" size=-1><span>
<b>Prison of Ice</b><BR>
Anya, a young alchemist and daughter to one of our slain elders, has disappeared.  She is a 
strong crafty woman with a spirit like no others, except for maybe your own.  One night 
just before your arrival Malah saw her and Nihlathak arguing about something.  The next morning she was gone.
<P>
Nihlathak has his own stories as to where she went, but Malah fears he is hiding something, something 
Anya knows about.
<P>
Find Anya and bring her back to Harrogath.  If something is wrong with Nihlathak, she'll know what to do.
<p>
<b>Given</b> by Malah or get within range of Anya in the area known as the Frozen River.<p>
<b>Tip:</b> Find and search the Frozen River.<p> 
<!--- Betrayal of Harrogath -------------------------------->
			<tr>
			<td valign=top><img src="../../images/battle/diablo2exp/images/quests/act5-4.gif" alt="Betrayal of Harrogath" border=0 width=50 height=50></td>
			<td valign=top width=100%>
				<font face="arial,helvetica" size=-1><span>
<b>Betrayal of Harrogath</b><BR>
Nihlathak plans to make a deal with Baal to protect this town.  He is giving Baal the relic of the 
Ancients, our most holy token.  It allows anyone to walk unfettered into the mountain.  Anya tried to 
stop him but he imprisoned her among the hordes.
<P>
Nihlathak must be stopped before he dooms us all.  His delirium is no excuse for 
his actions.  As much as Anya would love to strangle the life out of him herself, her imprisonment has left her 
too weak.
<P>
You must kill him.  Stop him from destroying everything we have fought for aeons to protect.
<P>
<b>Given</b> by Anya.<p>
<b>Tip:</b> Find the Halls of Vaught. There are four areas. Find the extension of the cross where
Nihilathak is located. Nihlathak will raise Minions to help him out. Don't waste your time battling
these if possible because he can send an endless stream of them against you. Nihlathak uses Corpse 
Explosion very effectively. Even players with insane amounts of life can be instantly killed. 
It's best to use spells and skills on the Minion Corpses so that they can't be exploded. 
Try to "rush" Nihlathak and destroy him as quickly as possible.<p> 
<!--- Rite of Passage -------------------------------->
			<tr>
			<td valign=top><img src="../../images/battle/diablo2exp/images/quests/act5-5.gif" alt="Rite of Passage" border=0 width=50 height=50></td>
			<td valign=top width=100%>
				<font face="arial,helvetica" size=-1><span>
<b>Rite of Passage</b><BR>
You are making your way up to the top of the mountain.  None here would ever dare get as close to it as you have.  
It is sacred to those of Harrogath; our most holy place.  The legends say that it is guarded by the 
Ancient Ones.  They block the path of all the unworthy.
<P>
It makes no difference what Qual-Kehk  or the others think of you.  It will be the Ancients that decide 
if you are worthy of this battle.  Good luck.
<p>
<b>Given</b> by Qual-Kehk or reach the top of the mountain.<p>
<b>Tip:</b> You must destroy all 3 Ancients without leaving the area. If you leave they will be
reset. If you open a Town Portal the Ancients will be reset. If no one is alive on the Summit (everyone
is dead or in town), the Ancients will be reset. The Ancients are very tough. Try to focus on killing
the easiest or weakest one (depends on your class, skills or party) and finish them off. Static Field
works great on Ancients without Lightning Immune or Resistance. Next move on to the next weakest 
Ancient.
<P>
<b>Reward:</b> The maximum experience gain is limited to 1 character level.
<P>
<b>Notes:</b> 
You cannot get credit for this quest unless your Character Level is at least 20 on Normal difficulty, at least 40 in Nightmare, and at least 60 on Hell difficulty.
<p> 
<!--- Eve of Destruction -------------------------------->
			<tr>
			<td valign=top><img src="../../images/battle/diablo2exp/images/quests/act5-6.gif" alt="Eve of Destruction" border=0 width=50 height=50></td>
			<td valign=top width=100%>
				<font face="arial,helvetica" size=-1><span>
<b>Eve of Destruction</b><BR>
Beware.  As you enter the gates to the mountain you will not be alone.  Baal, the Lord of Destruction, 
is already inside.  
<P>
Tyrael has always been our protector, but even he cannot help us now.  Baal has blocked our spiritual 
presence from entering the chamber of the Worldstone.  Only you mortal have any chance of defeating him now.
<P>
He threatens the Worldstone and with it the world itself.  You must stop Baal before it is too late.  
If he gains control of the Worldstone all is lost.
<p>
<b>Given</b> by the Ancients.<p>
<b>Tip:</b> Find the Throne of Destruction. Defeat all Monsters in Baal's Throne Room. Then enter the
Worldstone Chamber and defeat Baal. Baal can spawn in duplicates of himself. Try to keep track of
the real Baal (like the shell game) and do not waste your time attacking the "fake" Baal.
Static Field works very nicely on Baal to bring him down. Baal has many special abilities. Just focus
on heading directly for him and beat him up!
