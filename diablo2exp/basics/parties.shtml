<!--- FORMING PARTIES --------------------------->
<b>Forming Parties with other Players</b><br>
Parties allow players to share experience, gold, information about where the players in the party are located,
and quest information. Parties allow players to work together to beat the game. Many Class skills are designed 
to help not only yourself but other players in a party. A good example of this is the Paladin's Defensive 
Aura: Prayer. Prayer not only will heal the Paladin but will also heal his Hireling and 
other members of the party and their Hirelings. There are plenty of other party friendly skills and spells.<p>
<b>Party Options</b><br>
Press the 'P' key to bring up the Party screen. You see a list of all the players in the game and 
your current relationships to them.  Names appearing white are Neutral, green are in your Party, 
and red are Hostile. Next to each available player's name is the Party button with one of the 
following labels:
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>INVITE</b>: 	Press this button to invite the player to join your party.<br>
<b>CANCEL</b>: 	After inviting the player (but before acceptance), you may withdraw the invitation by pressing this button again.<br>
<b>ACCEPT</b>: 	The player has invited you to join a party. Press this button to accept the invitation.
</blockquote>
<p>
If no button appears, then the player is not available - because that player is already a member of 
another party. You may not invite them until they leave their current party. Of course, they could 
invite you to join theirs.
<p>
Once in a party you may leave it by pressing the LEAVE button at the top of the party screen.  If you 
leave a party of more than two players, the other players remain in that party. Once you leave a 
party, you may form or join another.
<p>
There are three or four buttons on the Party Screen depending on whether you are playing Normal or Hardcore
mode:

<p>
<b>Party Relationships</b><br>
Each player has 2 possible relationships with all other players in the game -- Neutral (the default) 
and Hostile. Changes to your relationships are made in the Party screen. (Press 'P' to bring it up.) 
Here is how the settings work:
<p>
<b>Hostile</b>: You can target players with this setting - just as if they were monsters. If Player 
X goes Hostile to Player Y, then Player Y automatically goes Hostile to Player X in return. If Player 
X goes Hostile to Player Y and then goes Neutral, Player Y remains Hostile to Player X until Player 
Y chooses to go Neutral to Player X. A player can go Hostile only while in town. The other player 
can be anywhere.
<p>
If a player goes Hostile with a member of a party, all other members of the party will
go Hostile with that player in return. If a player attempts to go Hostile to a fellow Party 
member, that player is simply dropped from the Party and becomes a regular Neutral.
<p>
<p>
<b>Neutral</b>: You cannot target players with this setting. If you try to target a particular 
Neutral player, the true target instead shifts to a nearby monster, Hostile player, or simply the 
ground. You cannot directly harm a Neutral player.
<p>
Neutral players may form a Party together. Party members share equally in gold and experience points. 
Certain skills, like Paladin Auras and Barbarian Warcries, apply to party members, too.
<p>
NOTE: You receive a message whenever players change their relationship settings with you.
<p>
<b>Experience is Shared within a Party</b><BR>
The total experience earned for killing a monster is increased by 35% when a party member of the killer is in the same named area, 
defined as the "level" on the Automap. Then the pool is divided as explained below:<P>
For each party member the total Experience earned for killing a monster is divided into shares -- where each member's 
fraction of the total Experience is equal to the member's level divided by the sum of all the members' levels. 
After this  Experience Share is computed, it is multiplied by another percentage that is computed on a sliding 
scale that is based on the difference between your character's level and the monster's level -- regardless of 
whether you are in a party or not. The sliding scale applies if the level difference is between 5 and 10. If the 
level difference is relatively small (5 or less), you get 100% of the Experience Share. If the level difference 
is relatively large (10 or more), a minimum amount (5%) of the Experience Share is earned. Thus, high-level 
characters killing low-level monsters get only a small amount of experience. Similarly, low-level characters 
killing high-level monsters get only a small amount of experience, as well. This is done so that a level 5 
character running around with three level 20 characters isn't getting ridiculous amounts of experience for the 
higher level monsters which only his level 20 party members can destroy. 
Finally, party members share experience only when they are in the same named area, defined as the "level" on the Automap.
<p>
<B>Experience Restrictions</B><BR>
Party Members must be a distance of about 2 screens from the monster death to
gain experience from party member kills. This prevents
  low-level characters from joining a party and then staying completely
  out of harm's way while still getting Experience.
<P>
<B>Gold is Shared within a Party</b><br>
When a party member picks up a stack of Gold, Gold is evenly divided among the 
members with any remainder going to the one who picks up the pile. Gold is only split 
when Party members are in the same level area or "zone" as shown on the Automap or party menu. 
You cannot turn Gold splitting off. Keep this in mind when trying to exchange Gold between party 
members and when picking up Gold dropped by other party members when they die. It's a good idea to
keep Gold in your Stash when in a Party to avoid Gold Splitting issues if you die.
To exchange Gold among party members without splitting the Gold use the Secured Trading Screen in town. Other
options include leaving the party to pick up the Gold to avoid the split, then rejoin the party.
You can also drop Gold in Town or an area, then make sure no one in the party is in the
same area when the pile of Gold is picked up off the ground.
<P>
<B>Improved Drops for Parties</b><br>
Every party member in the area of the kill increases the chance that stuff will drop (whether via 
monster death, chests, etc).  Every two additional other players in the game (whether it's a 
non-party member or a party member in another area) count as one additional party member toward the extra chance for a drop. 
<P>
For example (for a sample baseline 25% drop):

</TABLE>
<P>
Note that most things don't have a 25% chance of dropping something, so the values in the table 
need to be adjusted for that fact.  Also, some monsters (namely bosses and chests), roll more 
than once for items (since they can drop multiple items).  The bonus for additional players gets calculated 
into each roll.
<P>
Some bosses (such as normal uniques) will always drop a magic item or better.  The additional players 
will have no effect on them.
<P>
The additional players has no effect on the quality of the drop, it only affects the chance that items 
get dropped in the first place.
<P>
<B>Town Portal Restrictions</B><BR>
You cannot enter Town Portals cast by other players in areas
  beyond the "blocking quests" without having completed those quests:
  e.g., Canyon of the Magi/Seven Tombs/Duriel's Lair (The Summoner), The
  Harem/Palace Basement/Arcane Sanctuary (The Tainted Sun), Durance of
  Hate (The Blackened Temple), The Worldstone Keep (The Ancients), The
  Secret Cow Level (Terror's End in DII classic or Eve of Destruction in
  DII: LoD).  NOTE: A player who kills the High Council (but doesn't use
  Khalim's Will to smash the Compelling Orb) may take a Town Portal into
  the Durance of Hate.
<P>
This is to prevent higher level players from helping lower level players to advance further in the game
without working for it. If a player is unable to enter a portal, this means they need to complete a quest.

			<p>
Decide how you are going to divide up the loot. There are a few popular ways to do this:<p>
<blockquote>
Players unofficially rotate between items, "you got something last time, now it's my turn."<p>
The Group leader or Master Looter decides which player gets which item.<p>
The least structured method, but unfortunately most popular, is Free-For-All. Whichever player can click on the
items the fastest will get those items, if they have room in their backpack. When loot is FFA, often monsters
come second as party members race to grab the good loot. <b>Keep in mind that Gold is split so let
greedy party members grab up all the gold they want!</b> One thing to watch out for
in FFA looting are players who will let other players in the party finish off a monster while they stand
there doing nothing waiting for the item to drop. This is not recommended.
<p>
</blockquote>
Share items among classes that can best use them. You may find a Magic Staff that is worth money to the vendors but
do the right thing and let the Sorceress have the Staff if she needs it. Don't be a jerk, if a Sorceress
helps you kill a monster, and a Sorceress item drops, let the Sorceress pick it up!
<p>
If class-specific items drop, let players of those classes pick them up. Don't pick them up
just because you want to see what it is, or because you want to trade it. If a class is helping you,
they deserve a cut of the loot. Be fair and let them have their class-specific items. Let the Assassins pick
up Katars, let the Sorceress pick up Orbs and so on. Yes that means you, Barbarians!
<P>
Share potions among classes that can best use them. While all classes can use Mana, Health and Rejuvenation potions, some
classes need some potions over others. Casters need Mana and Rejuvenation Potions, let them have them. Amazons and
Melee Characters can use Mana/Life Steal while players like Necromancers, Elemental Druids, and Sorceresses have to
rely on Potions and their Mana Regeneration.
<p>
If you get a good item such as a Set or Unique, stop looting and let other players in the party do the looting
from then on. You got your good item so let them get items to make up for it. Don't be a jerk! Share the loot!
When you continue to loot items they will be thinking didn't that player just get something good? And they'll
be right! You got your item, it's their turn.
<P>
<b>Pick a leader</b><br>
This player will be the one who leads the group throughout areas and dungeons.
This player will open doors, and sometimes &quot;pull&quot; monsters back to the party to attack. Barbarians, Amazons with Melee Weapons,
Assassins, Melee Druids,
and Paladins are good at this job. 
<p>
An alternative method to a group leader is the wandering pack, which wanders off into an area and comes 
back together after running into trouble. "Hey I brought some friends for you!" This can also work and 
may or may not be as successful as having a group leader. This is the most popular but least effective method.
