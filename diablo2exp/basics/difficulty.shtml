<!--- MAIN CONTENT --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
All games begin on Normal difficulty. You can create and join games on the next difficulty level once you have 
defeated the game on its previous difficulty. You can create and join games on Nightmare difficulty once you have 
defeated the game on Normal Difficulty. You can create and join games on Hell difficulty once you have defeated the 
game on Nightmare difficulty. This is the case for each of your characters.
<P>
Once you have beaten the game on Normal Difficulty, you can create Hardcore Characters.<P>
<B>Level Recommendations</b><BR>
                    If your goal is experience, you may not want to jump into 
                    Nightmare difficulty right away after defeating the game on 
                    Normal Difficulty. The Monsters in Nightmare start at level 
                    36 and quickly increase in level. You'll find that these monsters 
                    have a better chance to hit you and you'll have a harder time 
                    hitting them because they are a higher level than you when using 
                    Melee attacks. Lowered resistances to monster attacks will 
                    also make it more difficult to survive. You will probably 
                    not receive as much experience as staying in Act V of Normal 
                    Difficulty for a while longer. Also Nightmare has the additional 
                    risk of losing experience when you die so you may lose all 
                    of the experience you have gained recently with a few deaths 
                    on Nightmare Difficulty. It's recommended to immediately complete 
                    the Den of Evil quest again on Nightmare Difficulty as soon 
                    as you have defeated Normal Difficulty for the reward and 
                    then hop back into Act V. 
                  <P>
To be safe, stay in Act V as long as you are earning good experience. You can still get good experience
in Act V until at least Level 40, and you can stay longer in this area by joining games
with more players which will increase the amount of experience a monster gives but will
also increase their hit points. You can test the experience in different areas by comparing
the amount experience you get within a given time using a watch or stop watch.<P>
Note that once you have defeated Normal Difficulty you will only be able to see Nightmare games on your games list for 
Realm Characters. You can, however, still create Normal Difficulty games. Characters that have defeated
Nightmare will only see Hell Difficulty games on their games list for Realm Characters but can create
games on any difficulty or join games on any difficulty if you type in the name of the game.

<p> Normal Difficulty is the default Difficulty level. Only 
   by defeating the game on Normal Difficulty level can you unlock 
   higher difficulty levels and Hardcore Mode. You do not lose 
   experience when dying on Normal Difficulty level so it's recommended 
   that you stay and level up there as long as you can. Before 
   you can advance on to Nightmare Difficulty you must defeat 
   Baal on Normal Difficulty.

<b>How do I start or join a Nightmare Game?</b><br>
You must first defeat Baal on Normal Difficulty.<p>
<b>Experience Loss</b><br>
When you die in a Nightmare Difficulty game you will lose 5% of your experience. 
The experience loss (5% in Nightmare and 10% in Hell) is applied to the experience difference 
from the current level to the next level. So, if you achieved level X at experience 1,000,000 and 
you would achieve level X+1 at experience 2,000,000, then the 
penalty is 5% or 10% of (2,000,000-1,000,000), that is, 5% or 10% of 1,000,000.
<p>
Retrieving your corpse where you died in Nightmare and Hell restores 75% of any experience lost at death. 
<P>
<b>Player Leveling</b><br>
Players will level up faster (from levels 26-50ish) in Nightmare.<p>
<b>Items</b><br>
                      Players will have a better chance of getting magic enhanced 
                      items. Monsters will also have a slim chance (10%) to drop 
                      an Exceptional Piece of Armor or Weapon with an increased 
                      chance for special Monsters (20%).
