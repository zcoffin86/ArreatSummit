<!--- MAIN CONTENT --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
The Amazon possesses strong abilities. Her passive skills are employed naturally and easily, no 
matter which weapon she has equipped. She should almost always consider developing her Critical 
Strike skill, which will double her attack damage. The Avoid and Dodge skills are also 
considered essential. Beyond the passive skills, she has an important choice. Does she wish to 
equip javelins or bows? 
<P>
The Amazon is easier to develop in her characteristics. While she will require enough strength 
to wear good armor, enough vitality to avoid quick death and enough energy to use her skills, 
her main concern is dexterity. For the Amazon and her weapon choices, dexterity increases not 
only her ability to avoid damage and her ability to hit her opponent, but it also 
increases the damage she inflicts. 
<P>
In terms of items, it is largely dependent on which path the Amazon has chosen.
If she has chosen the path of the bow, a good strategy is to aid Charsi 
in her quest, and upon the completion imbue a bow with magical abilities. 
If she has chosen to develop her javelin abilities, it would be better to imbue a suit of armor 
or a shield. Rings, Amulets and Weapons that Steal Mana with each attack will allow the 
Amazon to constantly use Bow, Crossbow, Javelin and Spear skills in battle.

<!--------------BOWAZON STRATEGIES-------------------------------------------------->
<B>Bowazons</b><BR>
"Bowazon" is the term people have commonly dubbed an Amazon that focuses on Bow and Crossbow skills.<P>
Bowazons should focus in Strength (about 95-125), and Dexterity. Dexterity as seen above is
calculated in determining how much damage your bow will do. You will probably want to raise Vitality
to survive higher difficulty levels and possibly find items that add to life. Typically you will not
want to raise Energy, but will instead want to use items that steal % Mana. If Strength and Vitality are
taken care of, dump more points into Dexterity, which will raise your Defense and Bow Damage.
<P>
<B>Skills</b><BR>
Long term, most Bowazons focus in either Strafe (10-20) or Multishot (6-10). You also have the option of 
using both although it's best to focus in one or the other. Freezing Arrow (1-10), Immolation Arrow (0-10), 
Guided Arrow (1) can also be useful for specific situations. For Passive Skills: Critical Strike (3-6), 
Inner Sight (1), Slow Missiles (1), Decoy (1), Valkyrie (20), Dodge (1-3), Avoid (1-3), Evade (1), 
Penetrate (as needed), Pierce (3-14), Jab (1 if necessary).
<P>
<B>Use Decoys and the Valkyrie</b><BR>
Valkyries and Decoys are very important to the Bowazon. Since the Bowazon is a ranged attacker, you want
to keep monsters away from you. You can use Decoys and Valkyries to keep monsters busy and away from you. They
can also help deflect damage while you attack. Valkyries and Decoys will cause you to fire additional
arrows when using Strafe as well.
<P>
<B>Offense and Magical Bonuses over Defense</b><BR>
Defense is usually not a concern when playing a Bowazon. Keep in mind that with the best possible
equipment (and no shield), 20 Evade/Avoid/Dodge, about the best you could hope to have is about 
a 54% of avoiding being hit by a level 80 monster, depending on your level, your defense, and 
the monster. So generally you want to avoid trying for high Defense plates, or raising 
Strength beyond 95 (Gothic Bows), 100 (Silks of the Victor), or 125 (War Boots, War Gauntlets, War Belts). 
While Defense certainly doesn't hurt, points in Strength could be better spent in Dexterity or 
Vitality, and high Defense items can often be swapped out for items that give you resistances, 
bonuses to skills, and other useful Magical Bonuses.<P>
<B>% Mana Steal and % Life Steal, Cold Damage
</b><BR>
Since you won't be raising Energy, % Mana Steal is very important. This would be important even if you
did raise Energy to be able to constantly use your skills without running out of Mana. % Life Steal will
keep the Amazon at full health and will allow her to quickly recover from damage, and use minimal to no
potions. Cold Damage is also very useful as it will cause your arrows to chill monsters. They also have
the chance of shattering (leaving no corpse) which will prevent monsters from raising their fallen friends.
Where you get the Cold Damage is not important. Popular choices are  are on the Bow itself, Eye of Etlich,
Frostburns, or on other equipment, 1 point of Cold Damage is all it takes.
<P>
<B>Find a Good Bow</b><BR>
The most important equipment to the Bowazon is of course her bow. A Hydra Bow or Grand Matron Bow are the top of 
the line bows. 
Until you can find a good bow, take what you can get. Maximum damage is the most 
important stat on your bow. Other things that are nice are Elemental Damage (which can be resisted), 
% Mana/Life Steal, and +1-2 to Amazon Skills. Weapon Speed is also very important depending on which skill you
use. You may wish to use a lower damage bow with a higher weapon speed. Any other useful stats are a bonus.<P>
<B>Imbue a Hydra or Grand Matron Bow</b><BR>
Your best chance (if not through Trading) of finding a good bow is to Imbue a bow.
Save all 3 of your Imbues to Imbue bows. You can purchase an imbuable bow from another player or 
find one yourself. Keep in mind any non Magical bow can be used for Imbuing. You may also be 
able to trade for a good imbuable bow,
Usually it's best to Imbue at around Character Level 34-38. The reason for this is that at higher levels,
more Magical Prefixes and Suffixes will be available which will improve the chance of you finding your
most desired Magical Attributes. The Prefix/Suffix levels of Kings (35), Merciless (32), Slaughter (25), 
Leech (6), Bat (6), Alacrity (8), Archer (40).<P>
<B>Space</b><BR>
One downside to being a Bowazon is that additional inventory space is taken up by Arrows or Bolts. Remember that 
two Horadric Cube formulae will help you out:
<P>
2 Quivers of Bolts = 1 Quiver of Arrows<br>
2 Quivers of Arrows = 1 Quiver of Bolts 
<P>
You can store extra Arrows or Bolts in your Horadric Cube, or rely on finding Bolts and Arrows in the field. You
can also just return to town when you run out. Stack up your arrows every so often so that they are in full packs
of 350 or 250 for Bolts.
<P>
<B>Parties</b><BR>
Look to team up with a Paladin using high Level Concentration. Many Bowazons tell tales of that being
the ultimate combination.<P>
<B>Bosses</b><BR>
If you're having trouble with Bosses such as Duriel, Mephisto and Diablo, you may want to try using
Level 1 Jab with a Lance. Another option is a good shield and one handed weapon if you don't wish to spend
a skill point in Jab. You may find this easier than trying to kill these bosses with your bow depending
on your skills, skill levels, character levels and playing style.<P>
<B>Duriel</b><BR>
Bring a Hireling along, use your Valkyrie, and Decoy to distract Duriel. You may wish to
move up to Melee range, even when using a bow to avoid Duriel's Charge attack (often a one hit kill).<P>

			<p>
"Spearazon" or "Jabazon" are the terms people have commonly dubbed an Amazon that focuses on Spear skills.
Spearazons are an interesting and challenging alternative to Barbarians and Paladins for a melee combat warrior.
<P>
<B>Skills</b><BR>
Jab is essential to a Spearazon. Jab ignores weapon speed so it will allow a slow
Lance to hit very fast. Impale(1), can be used against Lightning Enchanted Monsters. For Passive and Magic 
Skills, Critical Strike (3-6), Inner Sight (1), Slow Missiles (1), Decoy (1), Valkyrie (1-20), 
Dodge (3-6), Avoid (3-6), Evade (3-6), Penetrate (as needed).
<P>
<B>Use Decoys and the Valkyrie</b><BR>
Valkyries and Decoys are very important to the Spearazon. 
You can use Decoys and Valkyries to keep monsters busy and away from you. They
can also help deflect damage while you attack. 
<P>
<B>Find a good Lance</b><BR>
Look for a good Lance. You can save your Imbue for Lance or try to trade for one. 
<P>
<b>Equipment</b><BR>
Defense can be helpful to a Spearazon. Build up your Strength to 170 to wear high Defense Plates, War Belts, and
War Boots. You may wish, however, to always choose resistances over Defense. Find out what works best
for you.<P>
<B>% Mana Steal and % Life Steal, Cold Damage
</b><BR>
Since you won't be raising Energy, % Mana Steal is very important. This would be important even if you
did raise Energy to be able to constantly use your skills without running out of Mana. % Life Steal will
keep the Amazon at full health and will allow her to quickly recover from damage, and use minimal to no
potions. Mana Steal is important to recover the cost of casting Valkyries and Decoys.
Cold Damage is also very useful as it will cause your attacks to chill monsters. They also have
the chance of shattering (leaving no corpse) which will prevent monsters from raising their fallen friends.
Where you get the Cold Damage, is not important, popular choices the Eye of Etlich,
Frostburns, or on other equipment, 1 point of Cold Damage is all it takes.
<P>
The <a href="../items/normal/uboots.shtml">Unique Goblin Toe</a> Light
Plated Boots, can be very helpful for their 25% Chance of Crushing Blow which is a
chance of reducing a monster's health by 50% in a single blow. Although with a high damage spear,
boots with Fastest Run/Walk, Resistances, and Life are also an option.
You can also use <a href="../items/normal/uarmor.shtml">Rattlecage</a>, Unique Gothic
Plate for another 25% Chance of Crushing Blow if you find Hit Causes Monster to Flee to be valuable.
<P>
It's always best to try to maximize your resistances, especially to Lightning and Fire.
<P>
<b>Strategies</b><BR>
Spearazons require more strategy and patience. Spearazons can have it rough on higher difficulty 
levels due to lack of armor, armor raising skills, and a shield. Strategy can be very important 
to your survival. Try picking off monsters one a time. Use hit and run tactics. 
Use the Valkyrie and Decoy to help reduce the number of monsters attacking you.<P>

"Javazon" is the term people have commonly dubbed an Amazon that focuses on Javelin skills.
A Javazon uses Javelins and a Shield. When forced to fight in melee combat, the Javazon uses Jab and a Javelin or
Jab with a Spear.
<P>
<B>Skills</b><BR>
Poison Javelin(1), Plague Javelin(1-20), and Lighting Fury(20) are the main skills of the Javazon. At first Poison
Javelin is used, then Plague Javelin, then finally Lightning Fury once available. Plague Javelin and
Lightning Fury can both be used. For Passive and Magic Skills, Critical Strike (3-6), 
Inner Sight (1), Slow Missiles (1), Decoy (1), Valkyrie (1-20), Dodge (5-11), Avoid (5-11), Evade (1), 
Penetrate (as needed), Pierce (3-14).
<P>
<B>Use Decoys and the Valkyrie</b><BR>
Valkyries and Decoys are very important to the Javazon. 
You can use Decoys and Valkyries to keep monsters busy and away from you. They
can also help deflect damage while you attack. 
<P>
<b>Equipment</b><BR>
For Defense, you can decide if you want to focus in Defense items or treat your Javazon more like
a Bowazon which would mean picking items useful Magical Bonuses over Defense. If you focus on Defense, raise
your Strength high enough to wear high Defense plates, otherwise you can keep it low and use Leather Armor, Mage Plates, or
Unique Plates such as Goldskin, Twitchthroe, or Silks of the Victor.
<P>
The <a href="../items/normal/uboots.shtml">Unique Goblin Toe</a> Light
Plated Boots, will help make up for your low melee damage with 25% Chance of Crushing Blow 
(chance of reducing a monster's health by 50% in a single blow). Most Javazons rely on these
exclusively to survive in Hell Difficulty. This can also be
combined with <a href="../items/normal/uarmor.shtml">Rattlecage</a>, a Unique Gothic
Plate for another 25% Chance of Crushing Blow if you find Hit Causes Monster to Flee to be valuable.
<P>
<B>% Mana Steal and % Life Steal, Cold Damage
</b><BR>
Since you won't be raising Energy, % Mana Steal is very important. This would be important even if you
did raise Energy to be able to constantly use your skills without running out of Mana. % Life Steal will
keep the Amazon at full health and will allow her to quickly recover from damage, and use minimal to no
potions. Mana Steal is important to recover the cost of casting Valkyries and Decoys.
Cold Damage is also very useful as it will cause your Javelins to chill monsters. They also have
the chance of shattering (leaving no corpse) which will prevent monsters from raising their fallen friends.
Where you get the Cold Damage
is not important. Popular choices are on the Eye of Etlich,
Frostburns, or on other equipment, 1 point of Cold Damage is all it takes.
<P>
A Javazon uses a shield which helps protect her in battle, much more so than a Spearazon.
<a href="../items/sets/sets3.shtml#sigons">Sigon's Guard</a> (+1 to All Skills, 69% Blocking) is
a great shield. Later on a Socketed Tower Shield with 3 Perfect Diamonds will be much better on
higher difficulty levels for the resistances. The Unique Armor
<a href="../items/normal/uarmor.shtml">Twitchthroe</a> might also be an option for its 25% blocking which
stacks with the 3 Diamond Shield to make 74% Chance to block.
<P>
It's always best to try to maximize your resistances, especially to Lightning and Fire.
<P>
<b>Strategies</b><BR>
Some Monsters you will need to use your melee attack. When this is the case, use Jab and the Javelin
class weapon with the most damage you can find. You could also carry a spear class weapon around such as
a Lance to use with Jab whenever you need to (or keep it in your Stash). Jab a few times then finish
the monsters off with Plague Javelin or Lightning Fury.<P>
For Lightning Enchanted Monsters, it's best to throw Javelins at them rather than using your melee Jab attack.<P>

Although this term isn't commonly used, a Tankazon is an Amazon that decides to rely on Passive and Magic skills and skip both Bow and Crossbow Skills, and 
Javelin and Spear Skills. The Tankazon uses a one-handed weapon and shield. This style of play is very challenging and certainly not
as popular as other styles of play. The Amazon can use her passive skills to help with this style of play, but she will not be able to
use any skills to boost her damage (besides Critical Strike). She'll have to rely on Critical Strike and her equipment to do enough damage to kill the enemy.
The Tankazon can be a challenging style of play for those players looking to be different from
the hordes of Bowazons, Javazons and Spearazons.<P>
<B>Attributes</b><BR>
Spend enough points into Strength so that you can wear the equipment that you wish to wear. You will probably want at least
103 Strength for Rune Swords, 125 for War Boots and War Belts and 127 for Ancient Swords. Spend enough points into
Dexterity to equip the weapons you wish to use: Rune Swords require 79 Dexterity, Ancient Swords require 88 Dexterity. Spend
the rest of your points into Vitality.
<P>
<B>Skills</b><BR>
Critical Strike (5-7), Inner Sight (1), Slow Missiles (1), Decoy (1), Valkyrie (1-20), Dodge (7-20), Avoid (5-10+), Evade (5-10+), 
Penetrate (as needed). If you run out of places to spend your points, build up Valkyrie, Penetrate, Dodge or Evade. 
<P>
<B>Use Decoys and the Valkyrie</b><BR>
Valkyries and Decoys are also important to the Tankazon. 
You can use Decoys and Valkyries to keep some of the monsters busy and away from you. 
<P>
<b>Equipment</b><BR>
For Defense you can decide whether you want to try to maximize blocking by using Twitchthroe and a 3 Diamond Shield, or
try for higher Defense by heading up to Ornate Plates (170 Strength), and use a little less blocking. You'll probably
have more success sticking with Twitchthroe and a resistance shield which will bring you up to 74% Blocking (max).<P>
<P>
<B>% Mana Steal and % Life Steal, Cold Damage
</b><BR>
Since you won't be raising Energy, % Mana Steal is very important. This would be important even if you
did raise Energy to be able to constantly use your skills without running out of Mana. % Life Steal will
keep the Amazon at full health and will allow her to quickly recover from damage, and use minimal to no
potions. Mana Steal is important to recover the cost of casting Valkyries and Decoys.
Cold Damage is also very useful as it will cause your Tankazon to chill monsters. They also have
the chance of shattering (leaving no corpse) which will prevent monsters from raising their fallen friends.
Where you get the Cold Damage
is not important. Popular choices are on the Eye of Etlich,
Frostburns, or on other equipment, 1 point of Cold Damage is all it takes.
<P>
The <a href="../items/normal/uboots.shtml">Unique Goblin Toe</a> Light
Plated Boots, will help make up for your low melee damage with 25% Chance of Crushing Blow 
(chance of reducing a monster's health by 50% in a single blow). If you decide to use something else,
try to find Fastest Run/Walk Boots, with Fastest Hit Recovery and other useful Magical Bonuses.
<P>
A Tankazon uses a shield which helps protect her in battle.
<a href="../items/sets/sets3.shtml#sigons">Sigon's Guard</a> (+1 to All Skills, 69% Blocking) is
a great shield. Later on a Socketed Tower Shield with 3 Perfect Diamonds will be much better on
higher difficulty levels for the resistances. The Unique Armor
<a href="../items/normal/uarmor.shtml">Twitchthroe</a> might also be an option for its 25% blocking which
stacks with the 3 Diamond Shield to make 74% Chance to block.
<P>
For a weapon, look for a good Rune Sword, Ancient Sword, or Battle Hammer. It's best to look for the
fastest weapon possible. Find items that increase attack speed such as Gloves and the Unique Goldwrap Belt.<P>
It's always best to try to maximize your resistances, especially to Lightning and Fire.
