<img src="../images/druid/druidrender.jpg" alt="Druid" border=0 width=300 height=381 align=right>
In the ancient tome of the Druids, the Sc�al Fada, it is written that Bul-Kathos, the great and ancient king of the 
Barbarian tribes, had a mysterious but trusted confidant, who was only referred to as Fiacla-G�ar. This man is sometimes 
described as Bul-Kathos's close friend, and at other times, he is referred to as his brother. Whatever the source of 
their relationship, their bond was strong, and together they shared the secrets of the ancients: of the mysteries below 
the peaks of Mt. Arreat, of the venerated task put to their people to protect those mysteries, and of the prophecies 
regarding the dark times ahead. They both agreed that, in order to fulfill their sacred trust, their people must devote 
themselves to nothing save that charge. However, they disagreed on exactly how the people could best do this. Bul-Kathos 
believed that only by bringing the tribes together and training them in strict martial discipline could the tribes 
faithfully concentrate on their goal for generations to come. Fiacla-G�ar, on the other hand, believed that only 
through obtaining a spiritual oneness with the land they had sworn to protect could the people truly appreciate the 
importance of their role. Both agreed the other's philosophy had merit, and so around the time Bul-Kathos united the 
tribes, Fiacla-G�ar gathered together a small group consisting of the tribes' greatest warrior-poets and shamans and 
mysteriously retreated into the forests surrounding the area known as Scosglen. There he and his people created the 
first of the Druid Colleges, huge mortar-less stone towers, covered in vines and safely hidden beneath the leafy 
canopies of the dense forests. They have dwelt there ever since, forging a new way of life for themselves. They created 
a new culture and language, cutting themselves off from their Barbarian cousins and their ways, vowing not to return 
to the Steppes of Mt. Arreat until the time of the Uileloscadh M�r, the final battle between the men of the world and 
the demons of the Burning Hells.
<P>
Here, in preparation for the impending conflict, he taught his people the Caoi D�lra, a way of thinking that holds 
harmony with the natural elements of the world, its plants and animals, as the heart of its most intrinsic beliefs, 
for they are the personification of the very world that the Druids have sworn to protect. Not only was Caoi D�lra 
the basis for their system of values, but through its study and practice, the Druids learned to bond with the natural 
entities of Sanctuary. This bonding was so absolute that eventually they discovered how to talk to the plants and 
animals, and these beings taught them all the secrets of the natural world. They taught them methods to call animals 
from far away, how to summon sentient plants from the earth, ways to change their own forms to share the strengths of 
their animal cousins, even, to a limited extent, techniques to control the weather.
<P>
At the T�r D�lra, the greatest of the Druid Colleges, stands the magnificent oak Gl�r-an-Fh�idha. This tree is the most 
revered source of the Druids guidance and teachings. Under its branches, for centuries, the Druids of Scosglen have been 
honing not only their powerful arsenal of natural magic, but also the martial skills they have retained from their 
Barbarian forefathers. They have done this because they believe themselves to be the world's last line of defense 
when the time of the great conflict comes, a time they believe is at hand. Lashing out in fury at the recent 
insurgence of denizens of the Burning Hells, and at the Leathdhiabhala, demonic corruptions of the very creatures 
they have vowed to defend, the Druids have, at last, emerged from their forests, marching toward their final stand 
against the minions of Chaos.
<P>
<B>Traits and Abilities</b>:<P>
The Druids shun the use of traditional magic, or Dubhdroiacht, as they call it. They instead practice a form of magic 
based in their close bond to nature. Through this intimate kinship with the world of Sanctuary, a Druid has the power 
to command fire, earth, and the winds. He is a friend to the animals of the wilds and can call upon them to aid in his 
struggle. He can also use his heightened rapport with the animals to change the shape of his own body, drawing on the 
strengths and abilities of his woodland companions to better serve their cause.
