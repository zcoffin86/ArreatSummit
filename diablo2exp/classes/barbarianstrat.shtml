<!--- MAIN CONTENT --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
The Barbarian is the strongest class in straightforward melee combat. His weapon mastery skills  
supplement this method of warfare nicely. His Warcries add strength, as well as aiding 
his allies, making him an effective member of the party as well. Additionally, his Combat Skills 
aid his natural proclivity to melee combat, particularly his ability to wield two weapons and 
his abilities in leaping. 
<P>
The Barbarians characteristics can be confusing. Certainly adding to his damage by developing 
his prodigious strength is always a temptation. Energy would seem to be less of a concern. 
However, he needs enough energy to use the skills he requires, and it is the least developed of 
his characteristics. Dexterity is necessary for his attack rating, as well as supplementing his 
defense rating.  He has a strong vitality, but developing it further extends his ability to 
remain in combat and strengthens his stamina.
<P>
When looking for items, the Barbarian enjoys a greater flexibility than the other character 
classes.  Starting with a higher strength makes armament less of an immediate problem. As for 
weaponry, the only weapon he requires is the one for which he has developed skill. Here the only 
choices are to do more damage with a two handed weapon, retain a shield for magical 
resistance, or use two weapons. 
<P>
<!------
<B>Two-Handed Weapons and Dying</b><BR>
When using two Two-Handed Swords or a Two-Handed Sword and Shield, take extra care when looting
your corpse after dying. When you loot your body, a Two-Handed Sword is  automatically placed in both hands rather than
in just one hand as you had before. Your second Two-Handed Sword or Shield is placed in your inventory; 
however, if you do not have room in your inventory, the item will remain on your corpse. 
If this occurs, you will have probably looted everything 
on your corpse except for the Shield or second Two-Handed 
sword, which was unable to fit into your inventory. <B>Warning</b>: If you die while your corpse is still on the ground 
you may drop important items that you have just recovered from your corpse. This happens because
any items worn while a corpse already exists will be dropped to the ground if you die. It is therefore <B>extremely important</B> 
to make room in your inventory for those weapons <B>before</b> attempting to retrieve your body.

Defensive Warcries are shared with any friendly party members that are inside the Warcry radius when the Warcry is activated.
Offensive Warcries will hit monsters within the radius of the Warcry when
cast. 
<P>
Different defensive Warcries can be stacked, but only one offensive Warcry can be used on a monster at a time. 
If you cast Taunt and Howl, the last one cast will be the one that is active on the monster. 
<P>
There are three Warcries that can give bonuses to yourself and other members of your Party. Shout increases 
Defense. Battle Orders, a party favorite, increases the max health, Mana, and stamina of the 
Barbarian and his party members. Battle Commands increases the Barbarian and party members' skill levels by 1. 
These three Warcries can also be stacked, or active on yourself and party members 
 at the same time. The animation will rotate among these three Warcries to indicate all three are active. 
<P>
Once Battle Commands is available, cast it first, before casting Battle Orders or Shout. Battle Commands 
will raise Shout and Battle Orders by one skill point and will increase their 
effectiveness and lengthen their duration. By casting Battle Commands first, instead of after these Warcries, 
characters benefit from a free skill point for Shout and Battle Orders. 
<P>
Battle Orders is a favorite of Mana-hungry classes such as the Necromancer and Sorceress for the increase in
total Mana and all classes for the increase Life and Stamina for running longer distances.
<P>
The last Barbarian to cast a party-friendly Warcry will override the others.

<!----------
The Whirlwind-focused Barbarian uses Whirlwind as his main skill and sometimes uses Leap Attack. Times can be 
hard until level 30 for the Whirlwinder. Until level 30, find
a good weapon and use Bash, Stun, and Leap Attack. Once the first skill point is distributed into Whirlwind at level
30, it will be smooth sailing. Watch out for Horror Mages that cast Iron Maiden. If
you're Cursed with Iron Maiden, stop fighting until it wears off or have it healed. You can touch a shrine
to remove the curse. You may want to avoid the Chaos Sanctuary for fear of Iron Maiden at higher levels
and difficulty levels. Also beware of Mana Burn Unique Monsters. 
<P>
<B>Skills</b><BR>
Suggested skills are Whirlwind (20), Weapon Mastery of your Choice (20), Howl (1), Shout (1 or more),
Battle Orders (5+), Battle Command (5+), Find Potion (1), Find Item (1), Increased
Stamina (1 or more), Increased Speed (1-4 or more), Iron Skin (10-20), Natural Resistance (3-7), Bash (1),
Leap (1), Leap Attack (1), Stun (1), Concentrate (1). If you have extra points, spend them
in Iron Skin, or one of the "or more" skills.<P>
Barbarians have a Critical Hit that is based on the Mastery Skill Level, so it is important to maximize 
masteries. 
<P>
<B>Strategies</b><BR>
Build up 170 Strength to wear Ornate Plates. 
Build up Dexterity to the necessary level to use the best weapon
of choice. Place every other point into Vitality. It is not wise to place points in Energy
because the Barbarian receives one Mana per Energy point. Find items that give +Mana instead.
<P>
Assign Leap Attack on the left Action Button and Whirlwind on the Right Action Button. Try to lead
monsters into a tight pack, click beyond them using Whirlwind. Avoid stopping right
in the middle of the packs of monsters which can cause instant death. Use Leap Attack on dangerous
Uniques, and Shamans or other threats that need to be taken care of right away. Use Leap Attack to
move around, jump over Rivers or get where you want to go quickly.<P>
<B>Equipment</b><BR>
Collect enough % Life Steal to keep healed while you fight and enough % Mana Steal so that 
Mana does not deplete while fighting. Beyond that, try to maximize your Resistances (especially
Lightning, Fire, Cold), and try to increase Defense as much as possible. 
<P>
Look for at least one item that adds Cold Damage. This will chill monsters and some of them will
shatter leaving no corpse for other monsters to raise.<P>
<B>Weapons</b><BR>
The weapons of choice vary from Barbarian to Barbarian, but the War Pike is the best choice for Whirlwinders.
War Pikes have the potential to do the most damage and have a range of 5.
Some people choose to use two Swords, 
a Maul, Polearms, or Spears. Keep in mind that
Polearms, and Spears offer the best range, so when Whirlwinding, you'll be able to hit target's from further
away. Try to find Mana/Life Steal on those weapons, +Skills is also nice but Damage is probably the most
important stat. You may also find -Monster Defense Per Hit to also be useful on a weapon since
it strips away their Defense making them easier to hit. This is highly effective on bosses and other
high hit point monsters.
