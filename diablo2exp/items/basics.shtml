<p>
<b>Item Management</b><br>
Diablo II requires intense item management. You will have to decide what to pick up to take back to sell
to the vendors. It's up to you to figure out which items are worth more than others. Keep in mind that
non magical items can still be worth a lot of money, especially Wands, Staves, Scepters and Armor. Do some
experimentation and create lists of valuable items so you will learn which items to pick up. You can pick
up <b>every</b> item you find and sell it but it will take much longer to clear areas. However you
do it, it's up to you.
<p>
<b>Emergency Item Space</b><br>
If you have run out of room in your Backpack, Stash or Horadric Cube, you can squeeze one more
4x2 slot by picking up an item, and leaving it on your mouse pointer. You can exit
the game and join another, or just quit the game. The next time you play your character the
item will still be on your mouse pointer.<P>
You should not try this if you use an Iron Golem, as it might cause some problems.
<P>
<b>Stackable Items</b><br>
Some items can be stacked to fit, one on top of the other, in the same inventory slot. Examples 
include: keys, and all items that can be thrown or shot by a bow - arrows, bolts, throwing knives, 
javelins, exploding potions, poison potions and such. Stackable items have as part of their property 
description a quantity (even if the quantity is 1) when highlighted. As you use the item, this 
number decreases until you have exhausted the stack.
<p>
You may consolidate stackable items of the same type, like quivers of arrows, by picking up one 
stack and dropping it onto another stack. The quantities in both stacks are added together to 
form a new stack. If the resulting stack would exceed the maximum allowable number of stacked items in 
a slot, any extras will form a separate stack. You cannot un-stack items once they have been 
stacked. Note that only items that are exactly alike may be stacked. When using ranged weapons, 
an icon of "crossed arrows" appears on the Play Area whenever your quiver is running low on ammunition.
<p>
<b>What is the general order of rarity of items?</b><br>
From least rare, to most rare:
Low Quality Items, Normal Items, High Quality Items, Magic Items, Rare Items, Set Items, Unique Items.
<p>
Lower Quality items start out being most common but ramp to less common than High Quality depending on
the Monster Level (if dropped by a monster) or the Dungeon (Area) Level (if spawned from a chest).<P>
<b>Items and Gold Disappear after time when left on the ground</b><br>
Don't leave items or gold lying on the ground any longer than 
necessary, especially when transferring in town ("muling") as they disappear after a certain amount of time:
<br/><br/>
<li>10 minutes: Key, Potion, Scroll, Tome, and Ammo (Arrows, Bolts).
<li>10 minutes: Any Armor and Weapon of quality < magic, regardless if flagged as ''Ethereal'', ''Socketed'' or not, and Rune Words.
<li>10 minutes: Pandemonium artifacts (Key of Terror/Hate/Destruction, Mephisto's Brain, Diablo's Horn, Baal's Eye).
<li>10 minutes: Essence (4 flavours) and Token of Absolution (these are new items from Patch 1.13x).
<li>20 minutes: Magic Items, Gems and Runes.
<li>30 minutes: Rare, Set, Unique and Crafted Items.
<p>
Picking an item onto your cursor and dropping it again resets the timer.
<p>
<a name="durability"></a>
<b>Durability</b><br>
The rigors of battle inflict great wear and tear on a hero's equipment, eventually rendering the 
equipment unusable. Items subject to wear show a numeric Durability rating in their description, 
when highlighted. The first number indicates the current Durability of the item while the second 
number represents the item's total Durability. When an item's Durability is low, a silhouette appears 
in the upper right corner of the Play Area. Items with low Durability will appear in 
yellow. A red item has 0 Durability and cannot be used or re-equipped until repaired. A blacksmith 
can repair items restoring them to their original condition. Repairing magically enhanced items can 
be expensive, but often is worth the gold.
<p>
An NPC in town will repair your weapons and armor for a price. By repairing your items each time you visit town you
will reduce the danger of having your weapons and armor becoming worn out during battle.
<p>
Items can be repaired partially if and only if you have gold on your person AND the item is not 
broken (0 Durability).  Broken items must be repaired fully.
<p>
Durability is capped at 333.<P>
<a name="ethereal"></a>
<b>Ethereal</b><br>
Most types of armor or weapon, even one with magical properties, can be Ethereal. Bows and Crossbows cannot be Ethereal.
These items appear translucent in the Inventory, and when equipped, they appear translucent on the character wielding them. Their ethereal  nature gives them an improved fundamental ability. However, they have decreased Durability and cannot 
be repaired.  
<P>
- Weapons: +50% base damage.<BR>
- Armor: +50% base defense
<P>
<ul>
<li>You can place Zod Runes (Indestructible) in some Ethereal Items to prevent them from being destroyed.
<li>Ethereal items lose durability at a slower rate than normal items.
<li>The durability for Ethereal items is calculated as follows:  (Normal durability divided by 2) + 1.  Example:  An Ethereal Giant Conch will have (30/2)+1 = 15+1 = 16 durability, provided it is not a failed Set or Failed Unique. 
<li>Ethereal items spawn with full durability (albeit reduced maximum durability).
<li>Durability (maximum durability) values observed ingame agree with the following empirical formulae,
<br/>
Ethereal non-magic, magic, rare, or unique item: Durability = [normal durability / 2] + 1<br/>
Ethereal unique item with +durability (dur) as a magic property: Durability = [normal durability / 2] + 1 + dur<br/>
Ethereal Superior item with 'Increase Maximum Durability X%' (X = dur%, 10 to 15): Durability = [[normal durability / 2] * (100 + dur%)/100] + 1
<br/><br/>
Upgrading ethereal rare or unique items (using the proper Horadric Cube recipes) forces maximum durability to equal the normal maximum durability of the base item. Example: Ethereal Hone Sundan will have 15 maximum durability as a Yari, but 28 maximum durability as a Ghost Spear (upgraded). The +durability magic property of the unique items that have it carries over. Example: Ethereal Duriel's Shell (+100 durability) will have 126 maximum durability as a Cuirass, but 150 maximum durability as a Great Hauberk (upgraded).
<br/><br/>
Failed Set (double durability magic) and Failed Unique (triple durability rare) items spawn with twice and thrice the normal durability, respectively, hence:
<br/><br/>
Ethereal Failed Set: normal durability + 1<br/>
Ethereal Failed Unique: [normal durability * 3/2] + 1<br/>
<br/><br/>
Note: '[]' denotes rounding down (calculations are done with integers, there are no fractions at any step).
<br/><br/>
<li>Broken Ethereal Items sell for 1 Gold.
<li>Items that spawn as indestructible can not be ethereal at the same time.
Hence, most elite unique items that are indestructable will never become
ethereal.
<li>After being sold to a merchant, Ethereal items don't appear in the
merchant's trade screen.
<li>Armor strength requirements are lowered by 10, and weapon strength/dexterity requirement is lowered by 10, when they are Ethereal.
<li> Ethereal Items do not lose Durability on Hirelings.
<li>Magic, Rare, and Unique Items can be Ethereal but Imbuing will not make a non-Ethereal item become Ethereal.
<li>Ethereal items CAN be Imbued, and still be Ethereal after the imbue.
</ul>
<P>
<b>What are Low Quality, Cracked, Crude, Damaged items?</b><br> 
All of these items have a lower Maximum Durability than normal, except bows which are still indestructible. Weapons of this type have lower damage than their normal counterparts. Armor of this type has unusually low Defense, often going below the minimum Defense for that piece of armor. 
<p>
Any low (Low Quality, Cracked, Crude, Damaged) Armor appears to have 75% of the normal defense (don't forget that normal defense varies), rounded down, and low Weapons do 75% of their normal damage (mindam, maxdam), rounded down. Minimum damage is modified to 1 if it would be < 1 (e.g. a low Javelin has One-Hand Damage: 1 to 3 rather than the normal One-Hand Damage: 1 to 5). Both Any Armor and Weapons have their maximum durability degraded to [(normal durability - 1)/3], i.e. roughly 33%.
<br/><br/>
Low items cannot be ethereal and they cannot spawn with sockets. You can, however, add sockets to a low item using the reward from the first quest of Act 5 (Siege on Harrogath).
<br/><br/>
<a name="superior"></a>
<b>Superior Armor and Weapons</b><br>
Superior items have improved Defense, Durability, Attack Rating, or enhanced Damage. More precisely:
<p>
<blockquote>
Any Superior Armor (Helm, Armor, Any Shield, Gloves, Belt, Boots)<br/>
+5% to +15% Enhanced Defense<br/>
Increase Maximum Durability 10% to 15%<br/>
<br/>
or both properties combined.
<br/><br/>
[Superior Weapons]<br/>
+5% to +15% Enhanced Damage (or +1 to Maximum Damage, see below)<br/>
Increase Maximum Durability 10% to 15%<br/>
+1 to +3 to Attack Rating
<br/><br/>
or any two of those properties together. Note: it is impossible to have all three properties spawn together. Furthermore, increased durability will never display on Bows, Crossbows, and Phase Blade, as they are default indestructible, nor on Combo Weapons (Javelins, Throwing Weapons), as they display only quantity (they have hidden durability). If +5% to +15% Enhanced Damage does not increase weapon's base damage by at least 1 (Short Bow for instance), the bonus displays as '+1 to Maximum Damage' instead. In the case of Combo Weapons, One-Hand Damage is considered, whereas Two-Hand Damage is considered on two-handed swords.
<p>
Superior items can be ethereal, except if the base item is indestructible, and they may spawn with sockets if the base item can have sockets.
<p>
The Defense of Any Superior Armor spawned with +% Enhanced Defense (ac%) is calculated as follows,
<p>
Superior NOT Ethereal: Defense = [(maxac + 1) * (100 + ac%)/100]<br/>
Superior AND Ethereal: Defense = [[(maxac + 1) * 3/2] * (100 + ac%)/100]
<p>
where 'maxac' denotes the maximum base defense.
<p>
Notes<br/>
- '[]' denotes rounding down (calculations are done with integers, there are no fractions at any step).<br/>
- The above item defense formulae are valid for Any Armor spawned with +% Enhanced Defense and not just Superior with +% Enhanced Defense.
</blockquote>
<B>Circlets</B><BR>
Circlets are Helms that contain Magical Prefixes and Suffixes that you would not normally get in a helmet. 
They may also allow you to wear a hat without it showing on your character which will allow say an Amazon to 
play with her hair showing. Circlets typically have less Defense than regular Helms.
<P>
<B>Class-specific Items</B><BR>
There are specific items that are only usable by their intended class, possessing special abilities only pertinent 
to that class. Be sure to pay close attention to the requirements of each item as listed in its pop-up 
description to see if an item is class specific. 
<P>
<a name="chargeditems"></a>
<B>Charged Items</B><BR>
Some new magic items grant the use of certain skills to any character. Some of these items have skills that are 
only triggered under certain conditions, such as striking an enemy or being struck by one. Charged Items allow 
the wielder to use the skill at will, but only a limited number of times. To engage the skill granted 
by a Charged Item, left-click your right mouse button Skill Selection (or press the S key). The 
Charged Item skill is listed near the top of your list of available skills; left-click on its icon 
to select it. The skill can now be performed by right-clicking on a target. Charged Item skills have a limited 
number of uses, so be sure to check the item's pop-up description or the lower right-hand corner 
of the skill icon to see how many charges remain. If any of an item's charges are depleted, you can 
return to a nearby town and recharge the item by having the local Blacksmith repair it. 
<P>
There are a few related <a href="cube.shtml">Cube recipes</a>.
<p>
<b>Weapon Speeds vs Classes</b><br> 
Certain weapons are more effective in certain character classes' hands. The listed speed ('slow,'very fast,' etc.) 
is relative to other weapons for that specific character. Weapon Speed descriptions, as well as their actual 
swing rate, can change for a weapon when wielded by two different character classes. The listed speeds ('slow,
'very fast,' etc.) further describe a range of speeds; a 'fast' dagger might be slightly slower than a 'fast' 
mace, but both will be faster than a 'normal' club.
<p>
When numbers are listed for Weapon Speeds such as [0], [-20], [20], the higher the number is, the slower
the Weapon Speed. So, [20] is the slowest of the three Weapon Speeds.<P>
<b>If I have a 'very fast' sword, and I equip a magic item that Increases Attack Speed, will it be even faster?</b><br> 
The answer to this is yes as well, however at some point the speed maxes out, and they cease to get faster.
<p>
<b>Is there any way to tell when you have reached your maximum Weapon Speed?</b><br>
No, there is no easy way to tell when you reach the limit. You can get faster than "very fast". (Try the 
Barbarian Frenzy skill to see just how fast you can get.) It would be very hard to reach the limit, you can almost always 
get faster. All weapon types probably peak at the same speed, so the fastest possible Polearm weapon swing would probably be just 
as fast as the fastest possible one-hand sword swing.
<p>
<b>How is extra damage calculated in magic weapons that get a certain amount of extra damage from a 
suffix as well as from a certain percentage of extra damage from a prefix: King's will give up to 200% 
extra damage and Slaughter will give up to 20 damage to maximum, so on a sword with normally maximum 80 damage will 
this give 200% over 80 and then add 20 damage?</b><br>
Yes. In this case, first we apply the percentage, then the addition. This calculation can 
become very, very complex when factoring in shrines, auras, etc.
<P>
<b>Weapon Damage</b><br> 
Damage vs Undead and Damage vs Demons do not display on the Character Screen. You must calculate them
separately.
<P>
<a name="range"></a>
<b>Melee Range</b><br>
For players, range = rangeadder + size, where rangeadder is a weapon-specific constant and size refers to the target. The weapon pages list the rangeadder for each weapon. Monsters are either size 1, 2 or 3 (most are size 2 or 3).
<p>
<a name="qlevel"></a>
<B>Quality Level</B><BR>
Quality Level - Qlvl is an integer given to all items. This integer is primarily used for separating items into groups known as
"Treasure Classes". It is also used in the formula that determines the affix level of an item. The determination of an item drop will also use this number to verify if the drop is successful.
<p>
<b>Does the tendency to drop an item vary from Monster to Monster?</b><br>
No, however Unique Monsters and Bosses have a better chance to drop Magic Items. Champions will either
drop Magic Items, Gold, or Gems. Otherwise, the type of monster doesn't matter.<P>
<b>Does your Character Level figure into what items are dropped?</b><br>
No. The items get better as Monster Levels and Dungeon Levels rise.
<P>
<b>Is there a better chance to find magic items in locked chests?</b><br>
No. But they are usually double drops.
<P>
<b>Transferring Items between Characters</b> (Realm and Open Characters)<br>
You can transfer items between characters by having a friend stay in the game to keep the
game open while you transfer characters.<P>
For Realm Characters, you can also create a passworded game on Battle.net
and not tell anyone what that password is. If you stay in the game for 5 minutes, it will be placed on
a delayed expiration list. So when you leave the game and there are no longer any players in the game,
it will still stay up for a while. If you're fast enough (it doesn't have to be too fast), you
can drop items in town, quit, switch characters, rejoin your same passworded game, and
pick them up with your other character. However be warned this method of transferring items
can be risky. If you're unable to rejoin your game in time, you will lose all the items
you dropped.
<p>
You cannot transfer items between single player characters.
<P>
<B>What is Blizzard's policy on transferring items between characters or "muling"?</B><BR>
The transferring of items between Diablo II characters is not supported by Blizzard. Users should be warned that attempts to transfer items between characters online are risky and Blizzard is not responsible for lost items. Storage space is limited in Diablo II both for performance and storage space issues and because the designers wanted players to make decisions as to which items to keep and which items must be thrown away or sold. 
<P>
<B>Finding Good Items</B><BR>
Here are some tricks to use to get "good" items meaning more Rare, Set and Unique Items. You can trade
the good items you find that are not useful to yourself for other items that you can use.
<P>

<LI><B>Get lots of Magic Find</B>. For more information 
<a href="magic/magicfind.shtml">go here</a>.
<LI><B>Open up all Chests, Rocks, Barrels, etc.</B>. Chests and other similar items have increased
chances for drops. Combined with a good Magic Find % you can have a pretty good chance of getting
a good item from a chest. There are also certain areas where chests are more common. Carry keys
(except Assassins) so that you can open locked chests as well. You can carry some keys in your Horadric
Cube. If you carry keys in the Horadric Cube they won't work so you have to take them out of the cube to use them.
<LI><B>Repeatedly Kill Champion and Unique Monsters</B>. Always kill these (if possible). They have a much
better chance for good drops. You can even go to areas where they are more common or where
they are easier to kill.
<!----------
<LI><B>Repeatedly Kill Act Bosses</B>. Act Bosses such as Diablo and Baal
have a very good chance of a good drop. You can kill these guys over and over again for good items. You
will not get something good every time but your chances are pretty good for a Rare, Set and Unique item.
Magic Find can even improve these chances! "Baal Runs" are very popular.
<LI><B>Repeatedly Kill Super Unique Monsters and Quest Monsters</B>. Super Unique Monsters such as
Bishibosh and Rakanishu have improved drops. Quest monsters such as Blood Raven and The Countess also
have improved drops. The Countess has the potential to drop higher level Runes.
------->
<LI><B>Kill more Monsters</B>. Generally the more monsters you kill within a general amount
of time, the more drops you get and the more chances you have to get something good. This is
why areas like the Flayer Jungle are popular. You may wish to find areas where you can kill a lot
of monsters at once.
<LI><B>Activate Monster Shrines or Evil Urns</B>. This will create Unique Monsters 
or Champions that you can kill for better loot.
